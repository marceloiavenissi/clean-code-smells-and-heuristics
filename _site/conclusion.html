<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
This list of heuristics and smells could hardly be said to be complete.
Indeed, I'm not sure that such a list can *ever* be complete.
But perhaps completeness should not be the goal, because what this list *does* do is imply a value system.

Indeed, that value system has been the goal, and the topic, of this book.
Clean code is not written by following a set of rules.
You don't become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics.
professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.
