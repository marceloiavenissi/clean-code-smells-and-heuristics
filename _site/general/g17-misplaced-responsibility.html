      <h2>G17: Misplaced Responsibility</h2>
<p>One of the most important decisions a software developer can make is where to put code.
For example, where should the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PI</code> constant go?
Should it be in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math</code> class?
Perhaps it belongs in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trigonometry</code> class?
Or maybe in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Circle</code> class?</p>

<p>The principle of least surprise comes into play here.
Code should be placed where a reader would naturally expect it to be.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PI</code> constant should go where the trig functions are declared.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OVERTIME_RATE</code> constant should be declared in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HourlyPayCalculator</code> class.</p>

<p>Sometimes we get “clever” about where to put certain functionality.
We’ll put it in a function that’s convenient for us, but not necessarily intuitive to the reader.
For example, perhaps we need to print a report with the total of hours that an employee worked.
We could sum up those hours in the code that prints the report, or we could try to keep a running total in the code that accepts time cards.</p>

<p>One way to make this decision is to look at the names of the functions.
Let’s say that our report module has a function named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTotalHours</code>.
Let’s also say that the module that accepts time cards has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saveTimeCard</code> function.
Which of these functions, by it’s name, implies that it calculates the total?
The answer should be obvious.</p>

<p>Clearly, there are sometimes performance reasons why the total should be calculated as time cards are accepted rather than when the report is printed.
That’s fine, but the names of the functions ought to reflect this.
For example, there should be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computeRunningTotalOfHour</code> function in the timecard module.</p>
