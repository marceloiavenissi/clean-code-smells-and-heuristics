      <h2>G4: Overridden Safeties</h2>
<p>Chernobyl melted down because the plan manager overrode each of the safety mechanisms one by one.
The safeties were making it inconvenient to run an experiment.
The result was that the experiment did not get run, and the world saw it’s first major civilian nuclear catastrophe.</p>

<p>It is risky to override safeties. Exerting manual control over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serialVersionUID</code> may be necessary, but it is always risky.
Turning off certain compiler warnings (or all warnings!) may help you get the build to succeed, but at the risk of endless debugging sessions.
Turning off failing tests and telling yourself you’ll get them to pass later is as bad as pretending your credit cards are free money.</p>
