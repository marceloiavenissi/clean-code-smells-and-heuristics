      <h2>G24: Follow Standard Conventions</h2>
<p>Every team should follow a coding standard based on common industry norms.
This coding standard should specify things like where to declare instance variables; how to name classes, methods, and variables; where to put braces; and so on.
The team should not need a document to describe these conventions because their code provides examples.</p>

<p>Everyone on the team should follow these conventions.
This means that each team member must be mature enough to realize that it doesn’t matter a white where you put your braces so long as you all agree on where to put them.</p>

<p>If you would like to know what conventions I follow, you’ll se them in the refactored code in Listing B-7 on page 394, through Listing B-14.</p>
