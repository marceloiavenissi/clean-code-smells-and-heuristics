      <h2>G26: Be Precise</h2>
<p>Expecting the first match to be the <em>only</em> match to a query is probably naive.
Using floating point numbers to represent currency is almost criminal.
Avoiding locks and/or transaction management because you don’t think concurrent update is likely is lazy at best.
Declaring a variable to be an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayList</code> when a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List</code> will do is overly constraining.
Making all variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code> by default is not constraining enough.</p>

<p>When you make a decision in your code, make sure you make it <em>precisely</em>.
Know why you have made it and how you will deal with any exceptions.
Don’t be lazy about the precision of your decisions.
If you decide to call a function that might return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>, make sure you check for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>.
If you query for what you think is the only record in the database, make sure your code checks to be sure there aren’t others.
If you need to deal with currency, use integers<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and deal with rounding appropriately.
If there is the possibility of concurrent update, make sure you implement some kind of locking mechanism.</p>

<p>Ambiguities and imprecision in code are either a result of disagreements or laziness.
In either case they should be eliminated.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:11" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Or better yet, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Money</code> class that uses integers. <a href="#fnref:11" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
