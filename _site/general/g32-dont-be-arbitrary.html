      <h2>G32: Don't Be Arbitrary</h2>
<p>Have a reason for the way you structure your code, and make sure that reason is communicated by the structure of the code.
If a structure appears consistently throughout the system, others will use it and preserve the convention.
For example, I was recently merging changes to FitNesse and discovered that one of our committers had done this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">AliasLinkWidget</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">ParentWidget</span>
  <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">VariableExpandingWidgetRoot</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="o">...</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem with this was that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VariableExpandingRootWidget</code> had no need to be inside the scope of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AliasLinkWidget</code>.
Moreover, other unrelated classes made use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AliasLinkWidget.VariableExpandingRootWidget</code>.
These classes had no need to know about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AliasLinkWidget</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the programmer had plopped the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VariableExpandingRootWidget</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AliasLinkWidget</code> as a matter of convenience, or perhaps he thought that it really needed to be scoped inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AliasLinkWidget</code>.
Whatever the reason, the result wound up being arbitrary.
Public classes that are not utilities of some other class should not be scoped inside another class.
The convention is to make them public att the top level of their package.</p>
