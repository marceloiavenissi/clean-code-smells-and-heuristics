<p>Of what use is a default constructor with no implementation?
All it serves to do is clutter up the code with meaningless artifacts. Variables that aren’t used, functions that are never called, comments that add no information, and so forth.
All these things are clutter and should be removed.
Keep your source files clean, well organized, and free of clutter.</p>
